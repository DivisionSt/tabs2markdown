# Why this Extension?
I find I often end up with an overly cluttered tab bar in Chrome. As an avid Obsidian user, I developed this extension to help me transition these select tabs from my browser to my Obsidian vault where they can be referenced again any time.

The thing I like about this extension is how it grabs the Title of each tab and builds it into a Markdown link that is ready to paste into Obsidian.
